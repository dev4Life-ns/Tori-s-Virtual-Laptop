This application mimics the look and feel of a functioning onscreen keyboard. It is designed to be used with mouse
clicks. As such it is not a complete replacement for a physical keyboard. But it does provide a means to enter text into
the textarea  without the need for a physical keyboard. Apache Common Lang 3.12 version is the opensource library used
to demonstrate these advance features.Using opensource libraries is a great way to minimize coding complexity
and optimize code.
